Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a popular and widely used open-source Python library for machine learning and data modeling. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for various tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and data preprocessing. Scikit-learn is built upon other essential Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. 
Key features and functionalities:

**Wide range of algorithms:**  Scikit-learn offers implementations of many popular machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and more. 

**Data preprocessing:** It provides tools for data preprocessing, including scaling, normalization, and encoding, which are crucial for preparing data for machine learning models. 

**Consistent API:** Scikit-learn's consistent API makes it easier to learn and use different algorithms. 

**Model selection:** Scikit-learn provides tools for evaluating and selecting the best models for a given task, including cross-validation and grid search. 

**Built on NumPy and SciPy:** Scikit-learn leverages the power of NumPy for efficient numerical computations and SciPy for scientific computing. 

**Open-source and free:** Scikit-learn is an open-source project, meaning it's freely available for use and modification.
